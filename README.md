# This branch is no longer maintained. Please move to [the main branch](https://github.com/MerBudd/Techiee.py/tree/main) instead for the latest version of Techiee with tons of updates.

## This is the Python version of Techiee! There is a JS version available, however, that one is much less developed. Go to [Techiee.js](https://github.com/MerBudd/Techiee.js) for that.

## What is Techiee?

Techiee is... Well, a chatbot, like ChatGPT or Gemini. It uses the same Gemini (models) that Gemini (the chatbot) is based on, however, in Discord!

Techiee can be VERY random, but I love him for that...

## How to configure Techiee

You can tweak settings like the safety settings, temperature, TopK, max message history etc. inside the [config.py](https://github.com/MerBudd/Techiee.py/blob/new-api-transition/config.py) file.
